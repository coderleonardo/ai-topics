      "================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the implementation looks clean and well-structured. Here are some specific comments and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Functionality:** The Insertion Sort algorithm is correctly implemented, and the code follows standard professional guidelines for naming and commenting.\n",
      "*   **Readability:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `arr` could be `input_array`, and `sorted_arr` could be `sorted_input_array`. This would make it clearer what each array represents.\n",
      "    *   Some of the comments are unclear or redundant. For instance, the comment \"Create a copy of the original array to avoid modifying it in-place\" is not necessary, as this behavior is already guaranteed by creating a slice (`arr[:]`).\n",
      "*   **Performance:** As mentioned earlier, Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it less efficient for large datasets. While the code is well-structured and readable, it may be beneficial to include a note about the algorithm's limitations in terms of performance.\n",
      "*   **Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The example usage includes an unsorted array, but you might want to consider adding additional test cases (e.g., a sorted array, an array with duplicates) to ensure that the function works correctly in all scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for Improvement**\n",
      "-----------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Use more descriptive variable names.\n",
      "2.  Add additional comments or docstrings to clarify any complex sections of code.\n",
      "3.  Consider including a note about the algorithm's limitations in terms of performance.\n",
      "4.  Add more comprehensive test cases (e.g., sorted array, array with duplicates).\n",
      "5.  Consider adding input validation to ensure that the function can handle edge cases (e.g., empty arrays).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an updated version incorporating some of these suggestions:\n",
